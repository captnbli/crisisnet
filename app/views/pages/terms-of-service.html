<h1>API Terms of Use</h1>

<h3>For the Record</h3>

<p>The CrisisNET Terms of Use, which we refer to as the “terms” or the “contract," governs your use of the CrisisNET API. When we say "CrisisNET API" or "the platform" we mean the CrisisNET application programming interface (API) and any documentation and/or tools provided by CrisisNET that you might use to access our API, like our API explorer, official client libraries, and Developer Portal. When we say “CrisisNET Data” we mean the data and information that is available through our API. When we talk about "we" or "us" we mean CrisisNET and our parent company Ushahidi. When we talk about "you," we mean you, the person reading this. Lastly, when we talk about the "application," we mean whatever it is that you are developing or using that will access and use the CrisisNET API.</p>

<h3>This Really is a Contract, and You Really Have to Agree to it</h3> 

<p>Just so we're clear, this is a contract between you and CrisisNET and your access and use of the CrisisNET API is conditioned on your agreement that you will follow these terms. By accessing and/or using the CrisisNET API, you are accepting these terms and are agreeing to abide by them. If you are accepting these terms on behalf of your employer or your business, you are representing to us that you have the authority to bind that organization, company or business to these terms.</p>

<h3>Our Terms Might Change</h3>

<p>Occasionally it might be necessary to make updates to these terms. We will let you know when we make any important changes and when they go into effect. Your continued use of the CrisisNET API after those changes go into effect means you have agreed to such changes. If you do not agree with those changes, you only option is to stop accessing and using the CrisisNET API.</p>

<h3>What we Expect From You</h3>

<p>First and foremost, you represent that you are who you say you are, that you have not submitted fictitious, false or inaccurate information about yourself. You have to follow our Code of Conduct when using CrisisNET Data. You may only use the CrisisNET API to access the CrisisNET Data to use with your application, as long as you follow these terms and the Code of Conduct. Make sure that you understand and follow these rules, because they are a part of this contract and if you violate these terms or the Code of Conduct, your access to the CrisisNET API may be suspended or terminated.</p>

<h3>CrisisNET Data and Its Sources</h3>

<p>CrisisNET Data comes from many sources, and these sources may have additional conditions about how their data can be used and displayed (such as license rights, prohibited use, attribution, etc.). While we'll try to make those conditions accessible to you with each data source, ultimately it is your responsibility to ensure that you are (at all times) following the conditions of each data source for the CrisisNET Data that you use. The CrisisNET API also allows you to provide us with your own data and information that will be shared through the CrisisNET platform. When you add your data and information to the CrisisNET platform, you are granting us the rights to use, display and distribute that data and information, which will be made publicly available to others via the CrisisNET API as CrisisNET Data. </p>

<p>By providing us with your data or information, you are allowing it to be made public and you are representing to us that you have the right to allow us to distribute it through the CrisisNET API. You can include any licensing, attribution, and other conditions that you want to include with your data and information, so that users who access it through the CrisisNET API will use it according to those conditions.</p>

<h3>Prohibited Uses</h3>

<p>We may place limits on the access and calls you can make to the CrisisNET API. You agree that you won’t try to circumvent those limits or interfere or disable any functions of the CrisisNET API. We ask that you don’t go and build a competing platform or product, or anything that’s designed to drive users away from our platform or using the CrisisNET API. Be creative, be exciting, make something awesome, but don’t resell, redistribute or repackage the CrisisNET API or the CrisisNET Data as something else. It should be obvious, but for the record, you are not allowed to use the CrisisNET API for any illegal or unlawful purposes or in a way that could harm others.</p>

<h3>It's Possible the Platform May Not Work all of the Time</h3>

<p>As is the case with most software platforms, we cannot guarantee that the CrisisNET platform will always be available, error-free, virus-free, or totally secure. The CrisisNET platform is provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis and we disclaim any implied warranties. We are not responsible or liable for the accuracy, completeness, legality, reliability or availability of any CrisisNET Data that is accessible by the CrisisNET API. Any use or reliance on any CrisisNET Data is at your own risk.</p>

<p>To the extent permitted by applicable law, we will not be liable for any damages of any kind arising from the use of or inability to use the CrisisNET API, including any consequential damages, regardless of the nature of the claim or the form of action, and even if notified of the possibility of such damages.</p>

<h3>Is There a Lawyer in the House?</h3>

<p>You are responsible for any data or information you provide (and its legality), as well as any use of any CrisisNET Data by you. Any legal entanglements you might cause are for you to resolve and you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold us harmless from any claims, damages and liability (including from any costs and expenses we incur, such as legal defense fees) related to: a) your application and/or your use of any CrisisNET Data, or b) any data and information you provide to us that becomes CrisisNET Data.</p>

<p>If you violate (or we believe that you will violate) our Code of Conduct, these terms or applicable law, we can suspend or terminate your access to the CrisisNET API. We will not be liable to you if your access is suspended or terminated. You are still responsible for complying with your obligations under these terms (like the proper use of the CrisisNET Data still in your possession), even if your access is suspended or terminated. If your access is suspended or terminated, you will no longer be able to access the CrisisNET API or any CrisisNET Data (including any data or information you provided to us).</p>

<h3>A Little More Legalese</h3>

<p>This contract is the sole and entire agreement between us regarding your use of the CrisisNET API. This contract does not create or imply any partnership, agency or joint venture between us. This contract will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida, without regard to or application of conflicts of law rules or principles. All claims arising out of or relating to this contract will be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts of Florida, and you consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts. If any term of this contract is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, then that term will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the rest of the terms of this contract will remain in effect.</p>
